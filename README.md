# my-portfolio

This project should include the follwing:
- my name and photo
- navigation bar which links that to the corresponding section on the landing page
- these sections should include an "About Me" section, a "My Work" section, and a "Contact Me" section
- the "My Work" section is to contain images of my deployed applications, these images will serve as links to the deployed applications when clicked
- the webpage will not be responsive for different screen sizes and devices because I obviously don't understand.

Here are the screenshot and link to My Portfolio:
